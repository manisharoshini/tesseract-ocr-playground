“A Python-based exploration of OCR using Tesseract, including text extraction, layout data, and orientation detection.”

# OCR with PyTesseract and OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques using **PyTesseract** and **OpenCV**.  
It includes examples for text extraction, language-specific OCR, bounding box visualization, exporting results, and more.

## 🧠 About

This project uses Tesseract OCR (via the `pytesseract` Python wrapper) to extract and process text from images. It demonstrates:

- Basic OCR text extraction  
- Language-specific OCR (e.g., Hindi)  
- OCR with timeout  
- Character bounding boxes  
- Detailed OCR data  
- Orientation and script detection  
- Exporting OCR results (PDF, HOCR, XML)  
- Custom OCR configurations

## 📌 Features

✔ Read text from images  
✔ Display OCR results  
✔ Visualize bounding boxes around detected characters  
✔ Handle multi-language OCR  
✔ Export OCR output in multiple formats  
✔ Use custom OCR engine modes (OEM & PSM)
